# Agoraphobia Recovery

_a laymen's guide._


*Note - This is an early draft and will be a continual work in progress.*


## Prologue: The Cure 

The way out is not easy, but it's not a mystery.  This section would not have been enough to help me when I needed help, but I think it's important to keep in mind what the cure actually is. Everything beyond these simple points is about how to actually deploy the cure. It's the hardest thing I've ever dealt with - so don't interpret this as me saying "just get over it, bro."  I'm with you, but we'll get there. 






### Drop the Shame
This isn't your fault. Your brain wiring combined with your experiences brought you to this point. You didn't choose those things. You're not weak-willed, you're not a coward. This can be hard to understand from the outside. The people giving you shit about being a shut-in care about you, they want you to be healthy and happy. They just can't understand why you're so scared of going out with a tummy ache (or whatever.). The advice here will sound annoyingly similar to shit these people have been saying for years. Come with an open mind. 


### **Think differently**
Panic attacks are uncomfortable, but not dangerous. Agoraphobia hijacks the fight/flight response - there is no way to experience panic without thinking you're in danger. That doesn't mean there actually is danger, that's just how this works. You will not panic yourself into a heart attack, psychosis, fainting, losing control of the car, etc.. The feelings will appear, intensify, peak, and wash away.

No, yours are not different. I know, I know, trust me, they're not. 

Got it? Ok next: 

### **Act Differently**
Trying to make the feelings go way will make them more intense. This is, by definition, avoidance. Stop all attempts to feel less anxious. No breathing exercises, ice water, meditation, nada. There's a time and place for this, but that's not while you're in the habit of avoidance.
Test it. See what the feelings can actually do if you don't run away or calm yourself. Puking is probably the worst of it. So what? Swish some water and change your shirt.   The part of your brain that creates these feelings is deaf to thoughts, it only learns through being shown. Show it that there's no threat by acting as if theres no threat. Changing your behavior is the cure. The feelings will dissipate, but it will take longer than you think, and praying for that day to come is **avoidance**. The good news is that even the worst panic attacks are not that bad when you **don't resist**. 


### **Let time pass**
Live your life. Make plans, keep a calendar, go outside regularly. Maybe youâ€™ll feel relief after your first confrontation with panic, or maybe it will take much longer (like it did for me). Either way, if you stay the course, you will eventually recover.



Not convinced? Yeah I wouldn't be either. Keep reading. I'll try to address everything.
