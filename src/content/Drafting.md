Good question—maybe you shouldn’t. If I knew back then what I know now, I would've saved myself decades of bullshit. But I couldn't get over the idea that **_I was different_**, nobody understood.

I got the wrong advice from the right people and the right advice from the wrong people.

> The Only Winning Move Is Not To Play

- 
- Friends and family told me they feel the same stuff sometimes, I can handle it, I just need to buck up. 
- Doctors and Therapists told me I was wired differently and shouldn't feel bad about taking medications I need.
- GI Specialists told me to I must have a bunch of food intolerances. 

I needed to hear from someone who I believed actually got it. I had these issues my entire life basically, the feeling was often the exact same as food poisoning. I used to ask people *"if you knew going out would 100% give you food poisoning, would you go?"*. "Probably not" they'd usually say. This confirmed that what I felt was not tolerable. 

This isn't about me, but I'll give an overview I hope you can relate to. 
### Overall Timeline:
- **Childhood anxiety:** Panic attacks, nausea, vomiting when leaving comfort zone.
- **Teenage years:** Major panic attack at 17. Started meds and therapy, isolated socially, dropped by girlfriend.
- **Early 20s:** Became a total hermit, hooked on benzos, was convinced something is physically wrong. 
- **Mid 20s:** Tried exposures, made some progress, had setbacks, another relationship ended due to anxiety. Didn't believe exposures worked. 
- **Late 20s:** Heartbroken & depressed, moved 500 miles from home to force recovery or die trying. Finally got a glimpse of "not caring", found a new specialist. 
- **Early 30s (now):** Fully recovered, no panic attacks, completely fine.

### Things I Tried (That Didn’t Work):
- Lexapro
- Prozac
- Klonopin
- Ativan
- Xanax
- Propranolol
- Buddhism
- EMDR
- Multiple specialists
- Elimination diets
- GI doctors
- Microdosing shrooms
- got a degree in psychology
- Exposure **without actually stopping avoidance behaviors**

### My Symptoms:
- Nausea
- Vomiting
- Diarrhea
- Shortness of breath
- Chest pain
- Feeling of choking
- Insomnia
- DPDR
- Fear of psychosis
- Spatial disorientation
- Impending doom
- Dizziness

### A Few Lowlights:
- Failed out of college classes (eventually finished online).
- Lost dream job because I couldn’t cross a bridge.
- Panicked so badly during a traffic stop that cops thought I was on meth and I failed a field sobriety test, sober. 
- Jumped from a moving car on the freeway in panic, called a cab home.
-  Ruined a relationship that *probably* would've worked out otherwise. 
- Diagnosed with IBS (more on that later), lost weight I couldn't afford to lose. 

### Times I was sure it wasn't anxiety:
 - Woke up with full body left side numbness, tried to walk to bathroom but couldn't balance and fell over in the hallway. called 911 thinking it was a stroke. 
 - Airport bathroom, couldn't get off the toilet, cancelled trip because I was sick. Got home, stomach was fine. 
 - Throat closing, was sure it was anyphalactic shock 
 - Shortness of breath on a very short hike, was sure it was an asthma attack. 
 - Left my mom alone in Disneyland to rush to the ER, was sure my appendix had burst. 
 - Driving to a park with gf at the time, DPDR so intense I was sure I just had a psychotic break. 



So we're talking **20 years of crippling agoraphobia, 7 years on benzos**. And now I'm 100% fine. The thing that finally worked is supported by mountains of research. 

I can almost always successfully talk people down from panic attacks. Friends and family now call me when they're anxious. I know how to deal with panic better than I know anything else. I am **certain** that this approach will work for everyone with agoraphobia & panic disorder. I'd bet my life on it. 

Here's a caveat though: I've never had other complicating factors. Agoraphobia is a set of behaviors, and it can come along with other issues I know nothing about. I thought I had other issues for many years, but in the end, I didn't. This is a tricky part, you can be diagnosed with a bunch of shit that really is anxiety exacerbating normal stuff. So I'll try to have some humility on this - I don't know you, it is possible you have something else going on. But I think the odds that that's the case is very, very low, and there are ways to test this.
