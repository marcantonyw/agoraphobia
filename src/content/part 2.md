### **Reducing Anxiety**

Routine is extremely calming. You don't wanna be too rigid with this, you have to be ok if this gets interrupted - but do not underestimate the mood stabilizing power of a solid circadian rhythm. 

Stick to the schedule you made in the last section. Get up at the same time, eat at the same time, sweat at the same time. Fill your schedule with predictable time blocks that engage different systems. Focus, sweat, putter, relax, create, socialize, rest. The calm life is one where each of those systems has its time and place. 

Get tired everyday, physically and mentally. Really apply yourself - this isn't about productivity - this is about having a nice day. And a nice day includes times of effort in different dimensions, getting useful work done, and luxuriating in the earned rest that comes after. 


**Decisions, decisions.**

> Anxiety is the dizziness of freedom

The more time you spend hemming and hawing over a decision, the more anxious you will be. This makes us irritable, reactive, and gives way to rumination. 

This is one of the reasons having a fully scheduled week is so calming. You don't want to have to decide what to do with every moment of your day. 

Don't dabble in dilemmas. Almost every decision is reversible, and the long-term consequences of [irreversible decisions are unpredictable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWd6fNVZ20o&pp=ygUQYWxhbiB3YXR0cyBtYXliZdIHCQl-CQGHKiGM7w%3D%3D). Never perseverate over a pros & cons list before deciding what to do. 

If it's a reversible decision, just go with your gut and don't overthink it. Who cares what you have for dinner? Just pick something. 

If it's irreversible or high stakes, sleep on it for a few days. Let your subconscious mind work it out for you. I mean, do your due diligence, but once you have enough information to make a decision, let it go and let the answer come to you. 


**Dealing with uncertainty**

*Disclaimer: I would like to avoid discussions of Faith in this, because I don't want to alienate anyone and I know these can be emotionally charged subjects that carry a lot of baggage. My personal belief is that all wisdom traditions have some great mental frameworks for reducing anxiety, and in some cases, the best way to describe the mental framework is to use religious language. Please take this symbolically or metaphorically, do not miss the wisdom because it's attached to an institution.  


I saw a video of a man in the middle east whose house was reduced to rubble. He was standing in the rubble pile looking to see if any of his possessions survived. A man walked up to him to interview him. This is based on memory and subtitles, but the point stands:

> Interviewer: Sir, is this your apartment?
> 
> Man: Hello brother, yes this is. Mashallah, we are all safe. My wife, my daughter, we are all ok. Ah I'm so happy we're safe. 
> 
> Interviewer: But..your apartment is gone, where will you go? 
> 
> Man: Yes it is, but we're okay, we will find something, Inshallah. 
> 
> Interviwer: Do you have anything? Any clothes? Food? Water? 
> 
> Man: We will find it brother, thank you, thank you. 


Mashallah is an Arabic term used in the Muslim world to say "God has willed it". 

Inshallah is the same for god-willing. 

Think about what these words mean to the man who used them. Mashallah and Inshallah are essentially the past and future tense of a term that denotes complete acceptance of whatever happens outside of our control. Say what you want about Theism and Religious fundamentalism, but that is a beautiful, deep concept. 

This man reaffirms his acceptance of reality and his optimism in each sentence. If I can find the video, I may link it. What struck me in this video was the sense of peace this man seemed to have. Big smile on his face during the interview, gratitude pouring out of him as he stumbles through the rubble of everything he owns. 

How can those of us in the secular world learn from this? What wouId the inner monologue of radical acceptance sound like? 

I think the Alan Watts video I linked earlier here is a great place to start. It's a fantastic symbolic story of the unpredictability of life. How can we judge something as good or bad until we see it's final consequence? We really can't. That doesn't require a leap of faith - that's truly rational radical acceptance based on the fact that things unfold in unpredictable ways. 

I have benefited quite a bit from reading wisdom traditions. I will not make any specific recommendations here, at least not just yet. But I would urge you to explore these things. 

We must have humility about our understanding of reality. Our perception is not a perfect reconstruction of the world as it exists. It really is all up for interpretation. 

Now, certainly there are some facts about the universe we can know, I'm not saying reject science. But I would argue that an adaptive mental framework is more important than a factually accurate mental framework.

I do not believe things unfold as they *should*. Things just happen, in my view. BUT, when faced with uncertainty around how my life is unfolding - especially when that starts to turn into pessimism, I pretend that I think things unfold as they should. It is an effective bulwark against rumination in times of uncertainty. 


My recommendation here is that you explore some wisdom traditions, see if you can find a mental framework that helps you accept the way things are. 



**Using intuition**

You can sidestep a lot of my recommendations above if you just commit to listening to your gut. This is hard to explain without leaning on mythology, but I'll try to give you a pragmatic way to access this. 

Think of something you're worried about, or something that's been on your mind for a while. This could be as broad as "what should I do to improve my life?", or as specific as "What should I do this afternoon?". 

Sit down somewhere quiet, and ask yourself that question. You may be surprised to get an immediate answer. I don't know where this answer comes from - it's some part of the mind that's able to communicate with my conscious self - but its' reasoning mechanism is not something I'm aware of. I ask a question I don't think I have an answer to, and I always get a response. The experience of it really feels like the asker and the answer-er are two different entities in my mind. 

There's something in us that can pull information out from the depths of our minds without us having to work too hard at it. Overthinking just gets in the way. 

I think decision making is a creative act, when done well. Just like artists talk about invoking the muse to create something - you can invoke the muse to make your decisions.
